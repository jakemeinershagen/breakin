Decided to create breakout because part of the point of game 2 was to reuse assets from the first game.  
The angle problem was a little easier this time.  
Being able to steal stuff from other project is nice.
In about an hour I was able to get the wall, paddle, and ball bouncing. And some of that time was spent figuring out how godot works with copying scenes over.
